    "should not be used to explore the data, unless there is a well substantiated interest for mining classconditional data or discovering association rules with classes in the antecedent/consequent. Nevertheless,\n",
    "class attributes may be used to objectively assess clustering results and evaluate the discriminative power\n",

    "Excelling projects have four major characteristics.\n",
    "First, they show an acute understanding of the data characteristics and their impact on the learning.\n",
    "Excelling projects formulate hypothesis behind differences in performance.\n",
    "Second, they have precise and succinct language: no redundancies, unnecessary or subjective statements.\n",
    "Third, excelling projects are often a result of a creative thinking on ways of improving the learning.\n",
    "Illustrating, the justified use of a specific preprocessing technique (whether the inclusion of new features,\n",
    "space transformations, handling of outliers or specific forms of noise) can make a difference.\n",
    "Fourth, robust assessments go beyond simple performance indicators. Excelling projects draw (parametervarying) plots, test hypotheses, and establish ratios to understand less-trivial performance views such as\n",
    "robustness to noise, domain adequacy or overfitting propensity.\n",
